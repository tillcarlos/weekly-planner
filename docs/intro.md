# App purpose

I want to create a weekly planner app for my team. In my team we already do daily checkins and checkouts. On the checkout each team member shows what they have worked on.

Sometimes people don't check out. Or they do that late. In any case, it's hard to keep an overview.

That's why we build this app to have a Dashboard of the daily goals for people. We want them to STATE THE GOALS UPFRONT, and then tick off the tasks as the day progresses.


## Main problem

People plan but then don't follow through. Or they don't note that they are late on a task. Or they don't even plan.

We want to encourage them to plan their week more.

That's why we want to DISABLE the editing of the fields once they are written:

- Weekly goals can be edited until Monday noon
- Daily goals need to get written and then locked
- Evening status reports need to get disabled on the next day.

## The kind of app

This is a traditonal SaaS with multi-user login for my team.

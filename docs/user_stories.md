## Superuser

As a superuser,

## Member

As a member I want to be able to
- make my weekly goal list, so that my team knows what I am up to
- define my daily goals so that I feel accomplished when I tick them off
- tick off my daily goals so that I know what else needs to get done
- Check out so that my team knows what I did / that I'm clocking out now.

## Ideas came up:
- SMARTNESS-factor: see a score of measurability after writing down / locking a goal. Feedback by AI.

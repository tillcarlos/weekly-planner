# Our TODO list



## Database model

- task has original_planned_date. is that necessary?
- current_planned_date should be in this current week only. can be nil.


## Late checkout convenience

Can we have Statsaware send us a webhook to show when a user is offline - and then let our tool email the user and nudge them to check out.




## To think about

Do goals need to have a user, or can be shared amongst users?

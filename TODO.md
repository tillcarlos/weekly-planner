# Our TODO list


│ > the goals have a task list now. great. but there you should not be able to tick off a task. a task     │
│   should be dragged to a day (or even created on that day directly if anohter task is already there.     │
│                                                                                                          │
│   the goal list should show the tasks that still needs sorting.


## Database model

- task has original_planned_date. is that necessary?
- current_planned_date should be in this current week only. can be nil.


## Late checkout convenience

Can we have Statsaware send us a webhook to show when a user is offline - and then let our tool email the user and nudge them to check out.




## To think about

Do goals need to have a user, or can be shared amongst users?

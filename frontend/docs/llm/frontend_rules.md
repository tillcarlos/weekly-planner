# Frontend rules

## Tailwind

We want clean code and good UX. Respect these rules unless asked differently:

- If something is clickable (link/button), always add the hand cursor to it, so the user knows it's clickable.
- If something is a delete action it should always ask for confirmation (unless it was just created or doesn't have any data attached)
- Try to DRY components. When something can be encapsulated into anothe React components, and it's not too much incapsulation - then suggest it and wait for my approval
-

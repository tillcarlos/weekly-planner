Onboarding trouble:

Step 1: if we cay "continue with demo": create the demo, then forward to step 2.

When I have the demo integration: treat it like any other integration: offer a cancel button to remove it.


And accept presence data to activate an integration. but don't store the data unless the account is activated.

{"success":false,"error":"Failed to process presence data","timestamp":"2025-07-18T12:09:17.393Z"}%

the demo box should not be usable when any other is active (integration exist).
